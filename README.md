# sketchy

Used OpenCV in python to create live sketch of what's in front of camera.


Usually three different techniques of blurring are used :

1) GaussianBlur

2) bilateralFilter 

3) medianBlur

And two different edge detection techniques are used here :

1) Canny 

2) Laplacian


I don't prefer Robert,Sobel and Prewitt operators.
